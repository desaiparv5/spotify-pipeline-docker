# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install pins at all, therefore it may be a good idea to add it here.
#   Alternatively, you can add/commit the lock file (Pipfile.lock) to version control and stop
#   tracking it in this file using #!pipenv.
#Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/py_spy
